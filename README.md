# Project Overview: Stage 1
For this Restaurant Reviews app, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage One, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:
This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### Note about ES6
Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
